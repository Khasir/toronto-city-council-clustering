# toronto-city-council-clustering
Cluster Toronto city councillors by how they vote on municipal items

Data obtained from City of Toronto's [Open Data](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/members-of-toroxnto-city-council-voting-record/).

Ideas:
- Add search/dropdown by name
- Click on point to go to their website
- Move clusters to legend
- View by time period (mayorship?)
- Highlight by person (dropdown?)
- Filter by agenda topic (policing etc) (hard?)
